# Introduction
This is a reverb implementation based on Freeverb, a public domain reverb written by Jezar at Dreampoint in 2000.


The library is written in C and is distributed as a single header file. It should compile on pretty much any platform with a C89 compiler as long as floats are available. If you find a platform on which it does not work, please let me know.


IMPORTANT: The reverb currently only works with 1 or 2 channels, at sample rates of 22050 HZ and above.
These restrictions may be lifted in a future version.


# Features
verblib has the following notable features:
* Easy to integrate (the library is stored in a single file).
* Parameters such as room size, damping and stereo width.
* Portable ANSI C89 code with no external dependencies.
* No licensing restrictions (public domain or MIT licensed with no attribution requirements).
